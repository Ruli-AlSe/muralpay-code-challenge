### Coding Challenge

Using the Mural Pay API Sandbox Environment, create a single-page application that allows a user to create an account and execute a payment. More specifically, the application should allow for (1) customer & account creation, (2) transfer request creation, and (3) transfer request execution.

While Typescript and React are ideal, feel free to use the languages, libraries, and frameworks you are most familiar with.

For Sandbox access, please reach out to [boyce@muralpay.com](mailto:boyce@muralpay.com) with your resume and email address that you would like access for.
